KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

HDBSCAN advantages:
  - Automatic k selection (no need to specify)
  - Finds arbitrary-shaped clusters
  - Identifies noise/outliers
  - Density-based approach

Trade-offs:
  - Slower than K-Means
  - Sensitive to min_cluster_size parameter
  - May classify many points as noise
